          Graduated in Finance and then in Law from France and the U.K., I have worked both in France and in
          Belgium for several international insurance companies. I have very recently left my position of
          Reinsurance Analyst and moved to Innsbruck to join my partner and start a new life in this region I am
          already familiar with. Looking for new challenges, I have also started Web development courses.
